Install [gist-vim](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim) to quickly share code snippets.

`:Gist` posts the current buffer, or the current selection

It can open your browser and/or copy the url to the clipboard, default to public or private gists, detect the filetype of the code snippet, and also supports GitHub Enterprise.

See my commit to my .vimrc here: [JustinCampbell/.dotfiles@013b082](https://github.com/JustinCampbell/.dotfiles/commit/013b0828d8a0dbc84c06f952189ad350bcef78cb)

Thanks to [John Ewart](https://github.com/johnewart)
