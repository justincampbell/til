Vim `zt` scrolls the current line to the top of the window.

I found myself manually doing the same thing by jumping way past a line, and then back up again. Obviously, much smoother.

Also, it respects your `set scrolloff` size.

**Update**: Thanks to @raskchanky, who [tells me](https://twitter.com/raskchanky/status/334022588600823810) that `z<Enter>` does the same as `zt`.
