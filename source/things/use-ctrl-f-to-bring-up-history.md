title: Use Ctrl+F to bring up history
---

Use `Ctrl`+`F` to bring up history
when in Vim command (`:`) or search (`/`) modes.

You can then edit commands/search terms with regular Vim commands. Then, run a command or search for a term with `Enter`.

You can also access the history directly with `q:` or `q/`.
