Edit multiple things at once in VIM with [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors):

[![vim-multiple-cursors example](https://raw.github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors/master/assets/example1.gif)](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)

Simply press `Ctrl``n` repeatedly to select each subsequent match of the word under the cursor. Then, use normal VIM commands to edit every selection simultaneously.
