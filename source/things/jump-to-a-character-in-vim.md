Jump to a character in Vim with `f``<character>`.

I had gotten used to `/``<character>``Enter` from searching for longer strings, and @themoxman reminded me that I could save a keystroke.

Use `t``<character>` to put your cursor just before the character, instead of on it.

Uppercase `F` and `T` do the same, but in reverse.
